## What does it do?

It is a Shopping Application where users can buy as well as sell with the following Features :
Firebase Backend
Firebase Authentication
Firebase Cloud Firestore
Image Picker Plugin
Firebase Cloud Storage
Improved UI
Animations that Enhance the UI but do not make the App look Janky and Laggy
Custom JSON Animations (optional)
Responsive UI and Platform Adaptive

## A list of its features
Authenticates Users
Has a Catalogue Section to view all Products, Add Them to cart, add them to Favourites
Can Add, Remove Products from Cart, Place Order for Pay on Delivery
